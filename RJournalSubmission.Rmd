## Introduction

It is hard to pin down the time of the birth of the first Massive Open Online Course (MOOC).\footnote{Some have claimed Sesame Street as the first MOOC. Delaney Parrish, "Sesame Street was the original MOOC," *BROOKINGS NOW*, The Brookings Institution, June 18, 2015, https://www.brookings.edu/blog/brookings-now/2015/06/18/sesame-street-was-the-original-mooc/} But since the advent of more focused MOOCs pioneered by universities and platforms such as Coursera, Udacity, and edX, reserachers have tried to focus on studying MOOCs. There are fundamental differences between traditional education and MOOCs was large enough to attract reserachers to study students' behavior and outcomes. These differences are best reflected in the definition of MOOCs by \cite{mcauley2010mooc} that "[a]n online course with the option of free and open registration, a publicly shared curriculum, and open-ended outcomes which integrates social networking, accessible online resources ... and most significantly builds on the engagement of learners who self-organize their participation according to learning goals, prior knowledge and skills, and common interests."

Research on MOOCs few years with more data being accumulated and collected. \cite{bozkurt2017trends} studied literature published on MOOCs throught 2015 and found that the number of articles published on the subject increased from 1 in 2008 to 170 in 2015. More research in needed to fully understand the effectiveness, reach, limits, and the potential of MOOCs. However, one of the main challenges in studying MOOCs remains to be data. Data is not usually publically available since it is owened by private MOOC providers and there are concerns about privacy of students. More importantly, as \cite{lopez2017google} point out, the size and complexity of MOOC data is an overwhelming challenge to many researchers. Therefore, it is imperative to provide tools that pave the way for more research on the new subject of MOOCs.

This paper introduces a package called _crsra_ based on the statistical sofware R to help clean and analyze large loads of data from the Coursera MOOCs. The advantages of the package are as follows: a) faster loading of data for analysis, b) efficient method for combining data from multiple courses and even across institutions,\footnote{This is important since although MOOC researchers have access to thousands of students in their sample, few studies benefit from data across multiple courses and institutions. Such analysis helps draw more robust conclusions about student behaviors \citep{reich2015rebooting}.} and c) provision of a set of functions for analysing student behaviors.


## Coursera On-Demand Data

Coursera is one of the main providers of MOOCs that launched in January 2012. In fact, with over 25 million learners, Coursera is the biggest provider in the world being followed by EdX, the MOOC provider that was a result of a collaboration between Harvard Universit and MIT, with over 10 million users. Coursera has over 150 uiveristy partners from 29 countries and offers a toatl of 2000+ courses from computer science to philosophy \citep{coursera}. In addition, Coursera offers 180+ specialization, Coursera's own credential system, and 4 fully online Masters degrees. Courses include recorded video lectures, graded assignment, quizzes, and discussion forums.

Since the early years of the platform, Coursera has encouraged researchers to analyze students' data and has facilitated the use of the data and the platform for A/B testing. Starting November 2015 Coursera introduced a dashboard for self-service data exports. Through this tool, partner institutions and instructors can download data for a single course or all courses associated with the institutuion. Research data exports are sets of CSV files and are designed for use in relational database systems. One of the advantages of the data is the existence of a single *hashed user ID* for each student. This user ID is consistent for learners across all courses offered by an individual institution and allows for connecting learner grades and progress across course.

Talk about the advantage of not having relational databses



data can only be downloaded by "a single instructor to refine his/her own course or a research team at your institution (admins and data coordinators), to support broader online pedagogy initiatives"



Research data exports are sets of CSV files, designed for use in relational database systems. You can choose from a list of data types to download. Data coordinators can also use a single hashed user ID in all data domains. Learn more about data types and hashed user IDs.

To download export files:
Access self-service exports
Scroll to the “Research Data” section and choose the types of data you want to download (select all that apply)
Type a “Purpose for requesting exports” (e.g. how you plan to use the data, what research questions you’re asking, who will work with the data, who you’ll share it with, etc.)
Data coordinators: To use a single hashed user ID in all data domains, check the “Learner Identity Exposure” box
Click Export
Completed exports are displayed in the “Data Export History” section. Click Download to save the files.
