Why this paper?

\begin{itemize}
    \item one challenge in studying moocs is data
    \item even when data are available, the difficulty of data analysis makes it hard for researcher
    \item therefore, I provided this paper
    \item in this paper I introduce the package and run an analysis of students progress using the package.
\end{itemize}
